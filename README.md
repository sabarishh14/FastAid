Created using Python and various libraries, including Tkinter, FAST AID offers enhanced code reusability and object-oriented programming 
for efficient management. With a focus on real-life situations and a user-friendly interface, FAST AID promotes accessibility for all users 
seeking quality medical care during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

## SIGN UP - For Creating A New Account
The user has to first create a new account if he/she doesn’t have one before going on with the rest of the program. For that, the user has to enter the following details.  
•	NAME
•	USERNAME
•	PASSWORD
•	PHONE NUMBER
•	GENDER
•	EMAIL-ID
After the data is entered with the conditions applied, the user has successfully registered an account in the FAST AID database.

### SIGN IN - For Booking Appointments In The Hospitals
If the user has created an account successfully, the user must then sign in to the program with the exact login details. Then, the user will get a variety of options to select the AREA OF MEDICAL ISSUE and the location where the user wants to visit the hospital/clinic/pharmacy as per the user’s ease. Our Program selects the Best Doctors And Clinics around the USER’S LOCATION and gives full flexibility to choose the timings for the appointment. 
Then, the application will provide details regarding the hospital/clinic/pharmacy’s address. It will also provide the professional’s name and phone number. Then, the user must contact the doctor at the chosen appointment timing (audio or video call – as per comfortability) and explain the medical difficulty. The doctor will then assist the user according to the seriousness of the problem wherein the doctor may want the user to meet him/her in person.


### EMERGENCY FAST AID LOGIN - For Emergencies
We found more than one in ten people, that is 11 per cent in India, that had been to accident and emergency service in relation to drug accidents, drink and drive accidents, etc. Many people choose to use the accident and emergency department of a hospital instead of going to see their own doctor. That is why EMERGENCY FAST AID LOGIN on the whole is especially made for situations like these. This is one of the main features in our application. In a situation of emergency and panic, nobody has the time and patience for creating or logging into an account in the application. All that the user wants to do is to find out the best and nearest hospital/pharmacy. This is why in this feature we have made it with the least complications and all that the user has to do is enter their number, then enumerate the problem and location. Then the application will automatically curate the nearest hospital/pharmacy. After that the program will display all the details regarding the hospital/pharmacy namely the hospital/pharmacy's phone number, the doctor's name and the address of the hospital/pharmacy. These details are sufficient for the user to either contact or go to the hospital/pharmacy first hand immediately. We also provide some of the main first aid tips according to the selected medical issue.


### FAST AID COVID-19 CHECK – Self Health Checkup
Still being in a situation of the worldly disease called the COVID-19 strain of the corona virus. It is not known where in the marine environment the pandemic strains originated, where and how the serovariants emerged, and how these strains spread accurately. In the event of a pandemic, sudden deaths from circulatory disease are most likely to occur anytime of the day. In such a situation one can use the emergency feature in the application, but if not an emergency or just a common cold or cough how should a person be able to come to a conclusion whether he/she must visit a doctor or not? That is why we have built this feature in our app wherein the user has to take a small survey in which the user is asked a few questions about the breathing, tiredness, coughing, etc. And based on the results, the application will recommend a few things (which is most likely to tell if the user is doing well or not). With the user’s well-being in mind, we have used a special module called the WEB BROWSER MODULE to direct the user if they want to purchase a few products for the better health protection like mask and sanitizer automatically.
And once the user has come to a conclusion, there are a few directions that we have set for the user to follow for their own and the society's well-being (like social distancing rules, precautions, etc.).

### COVID-19 STATS – The COVID Count
The COVID-19 Stats is one of the special features in our application where the program provides 100% accurate real-time count of the preceding POSITIVE COVID-19 CASES and DEATHS. This includes the COVID-19 Statistics of mainly 5 countries namely INDIA, USA, AUSTRALIA, CHINA & BAHRAIN. The foremost reason why we included this feature in our application is because we want each and every user to be aware and informed about the current situation, not only in their own precedence but everywhere around them too.

### ADMIN SERVICES - For Program Developers
This feature is accessible only for admin members(currently our team). This feature is made so that the admins can monitor what type of people are using the application and if these people are real or fake. This is to prevent future problems like safety of users and the application data. In this feature the admin has to first sign in with the one-time admin username and password. Then the admin can inspect all account details or delete registered accounts as well.

### EXIT
Once the user has used FAST AID, if they wish to exit they can use this feature. In this feature, the user is asked whether they wish to proceed and stop using the application and once specified in a few seconds it will automatically stop running the program and exit the user login.
